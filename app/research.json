      "description": "Research on data visualization aims at finding the best way to present data via visual interfaces. We introduce the complementary problem of 'data vocalization.' Our goal is to present relational data in the most efficient way via voice output. This problem setting is motivated by emerging tools and devices (e.g., Google Home, Amazon Echo, Appleâ€™s Siri, or voice-based SQL interfaces) that communicate data primarily via audio output to their users..."
